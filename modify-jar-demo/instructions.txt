Instructions

1. Change to modify-jar-demo directory
2. run `mkdir before && cd before`
3. run `jar -xf ../TicTacToe.jar`
4. run `cat META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`, and you'll see the default MANIFEST.MF file
5. run `cd ..`
6. run `javac ZipFSPUser.java`
7. run `java ZipFSPUser`
8. run `mkdir after && cd after`
9. run `jar -xf ../TicTacToe.jar`
10. run `cat META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`
11. And you'll see this very instruction!

So far I can only do it by replacing the entire file
I still have not figured out how to "edit" the file, if we ever need that
